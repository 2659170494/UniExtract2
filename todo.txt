// Bugs
jsmsi: .cab not found (working dir?)
percentage indicator fixed? //inno

// Short term



// Known bugs:
Converting to iso failes when iso file already exists (helper binary not terminating correctly)
Overwriting files in general depends on extractor (sometimes asks, sometimes overwrites without asking)
Error messages appear sometimes althought extracted correctly
7z generic .exe extraction mostly results in not useful files //not a bug
batch mode might stop depending on the extractor, when user input is needed //make sure files do not exist before starting batch mode to avoid this

!!Compiling 64 bit version results in drag & drop application error!!
