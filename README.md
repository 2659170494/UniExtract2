# UniExtract
Universal Extractor 2 or Universal Extractor (Bioruebe version) as it is also called to avoid confusion is an unofficial updated and extended version of the [original UniExtract by Jared Breland](http://legroom.net/software/uniextract). As the development of the original version has stopped and no update has been published for years, many forked (modified and maintained by the community) Universal Extractors have arised. This is the most advanced and the only one with a fully transparent development using a public GitHub-powered source code repository.


As a short overview, here are some key features, which are new in this release:
- Batch mode
- Silent mode, not showing any prompts
- Scan only mode to determine file types without extracting
- Integrated updater
- 100+ new supported file types
- Audio and video extraction for multimedia files
- Cascading context menu
- Support for password list for common archives
- Improved optional status box with progress indicator
- New detection methods + more detailed output and error messages
- Support for some extractors not shipping with UniExtract as plugins
- Resource usage/speed improvements, lots of fixes
- First start assistant instead of installer
- Full functionality available in no-install version
- Auto-using 64 bit versions of extractors if supported by OS

See the changelog for a complete log of all improvements.

Universal Extractor uses [TrIDLib by Marco Pontello](http://mark0.net/code-tridlib-e.html) and many other great tools and libraries to support as many file formats as possible. A detailed list can be found [here](https://github.com/Bioruebe/UniExtract2/blob/master/helper_binaries_info.txt).
