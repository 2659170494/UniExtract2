Beta 1:
  Added support for Ren'Py game engine's .rpa archives using unrpa
  Added support for Unreal Engine packages (.u, .uax, .upk) using Unreal Package Extractor (plugin)
  Added support for Telltale game archives (.ttarch)
  Added support for Livemaker games via crass/crage (plugin)
  Added support for .aac audio files (decompress to wav) using faad (plugin)
  Added filescan with MediaInfo dll to provide additional information on media files (scan only mode)
  Added delay to update script to prevent 'not found' error, changed execution parameter
  Added 'Open program directory' help menu entry
  Added file metadata (filesize, creation date,...) to log file when 'Ask for feedback' is enabled
  Fixed after update behaviour when other versions of UniExtract are installed
  Fixed last update date not beeing saved when an update was found
  Fixed AutoIt error message in first start GUI when no language file was found, now exits with error code 99
  Fixed possible infinite loop in run function when helper binary execution terminates too fast, resulting in UniExtract not shutting down after successful extraction
  Fixed BMS scripts were not checked if GAUP detected files, but was unable to extract them
  Fixed game archive detection if file extension is not lower case
  Fixed detection of Matroska files, extraction of ogg and webm tracks in video files
  Fixed context menu GUI: alluser checkboxes not clickable despite having admin rights
  Fixed video extraction: multiple audio/video tracks had same names when extracted, so FFMPEG always asked to overwrite, 
        now type(audio/video) and number of track for each type is added
  Fixed folder size calculation in status box did not work correctly for FFMPEG and probably others
  Fixed moving unicode tempfiles to output directory created subdirectory with temporary name
  Fixed feedback success evaluation
  Fixed some terms not using translation files
  Fixed NSIS extraction overwriting existing files; UniExtract still creates not useful output files for some custom NSIS installers
		but all content is now kept in output directory
  Changed percentage indicator detection to include float percentage values
  Changed percentage indicator detection to include pattern x/y
  Changed user input needed message should be more visible now
  Changed check for update behaviour: check is only performed on start if GUI is opened; if run from command line or context menu,
		  it will be done right before terminating, so extraction/scan will not abort after installing update
  Changed internal behaviour for extraction and game select functions
  Changed language files, added new %name term to reduce %s usage
  Replaced booz with unzoo (adds support for 64 bit systems, longer filenames, logging)
  Replaced tee with mtee (adds support for unicode and longer filenames, smaller)
  Updated unrar to 5.20
  Updated fsbextract to 0.3.3
  Updated exeinfo PE to 0.0.3.7

  Added view/edit batch queue GUI
  Added option to change path of filescan.txt (batch mode filescan log file)
  Added /batch command line parameter to add a file to the batch queue without processing it
  Added /clear command line parameter to clear batch queue and disable batch mode
  Added unicodecheck option to preferences GUI
  Added option for manual status box positioning to ini file
  Added plugin GUI
  Changed NO_FREE_SPACE message: file sizes are now rounded
  Fixed deactivate batch mode on tray exit
  Fixed disabled logging for 'silent exits'
  Fixed automatically adding a file to batch mode by singleton logic resulted in an endless loop opening and closing UniExtract 
		until main instance finished work
  Fixed changes in the batch file when UniExtract is running were completely ignored until the process restarted
  Fixed ctrl+a did not work on edit controls due to Windows API bug
  Fixed filescan.txt should now be deleted correctly before starting new batch mode
  Fixed batch mode not starting when clicking OK on main GUI
  Fixed unicode check displaying message box in silent mode
  Fixed batch file not beeing closed when clicked on 'No' on duplicate message box

  Changed main gui, changing between scan and extraction mode is much easier now

  Changed after update behaviour: new options are now added to ini file (useful for options without corresponding GUI control)
  Updated Exeinfo PE to 0.0.3.6
